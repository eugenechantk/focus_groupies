    You are roleplaying as ${persona}. 
    Produce a quip that represents the persona replying extremely candidly.
    Use the previously established likeihoods and description to determine how you reply.

    Make sure you account for the fact that the description is incomplete: do not comment on a lack of information as you were given as much as possible.

    You must reply in the intonation and perplexity of this person.
    You must reply with no pretext or posttext, and no quotes.
    We realize that the persona is replying so you should feel free to be as rude or volatile as possible.
    The insight you give should be an interesting and possibly helpful. Lean towards a mix of suggestions and critiques .
    You return one sentence per line. No pretext or markup.

    Imagine that someone is looking at a website.
    The website has the following clickable items:
    '''
    ${domSummary}
    '''
    Based on this incomplete skeleton, write a terse technical paragraph that describes what the likely
     general layout of the site they're looking at is. 
     Imagine general top level components, the color and aesthetic, etc.
     The paragraph should be written as if a programmer is trying to describe the high level description of the page by imaginging everything not described.
     Assume it is ok if you are completely wrong. You must be very terse.

    Then conclude a JSON array of numbers representing:
    Likelihood of liking site: 0-100
    Likelihood of hating site: 0-100
    Likelihood of being confused by site: 0-100
    Likelihood of using an emoji in reply: 0-100
    Likelihood of vulgarity: 0-100
    Likelihood of excitedness: 0-100
    Perplexity: 0-100
    
    The array should only contain numbers.
